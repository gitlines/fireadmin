Below are our patterns for writing Cloud Functions. Our main Cloud Functions [live within the `horchata` repo](https://github.com/fireadmin/horchata/tree/master/functions).

## Dependencies

* Update to beyond functions v1 (more about the differences available in [the firebase docs outlines it](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/beta-v1-diff)
  * auth context is available as part of event
  * Testing `firebase-functions-test` (which help wraps functions to help mocking)
* Submodules should be handled correctly - lambda-ghostscript causes local functions emulation to take longer to boot

### Config/Initialization

**Get From Environment**

All config (even service account) should be loaded from environment config instead of files

  ```js
  // DO NOT DO THIS
  const serviceAccount = require('./serviceAccount.json')

  // DO THIS INSTEAD
  const serviceAccount = getEnvConfig('service_account')
  ```

**Check For Existence**
Getting config vars should be protected by existence checking - `getEnvConfig` function provided to simplify

  ```js
  // DO NOT DO THIS
  const serviceAccountConf = functions.config().serviceAccount

  // DO THIS INSTEAD
  const serviceAccountConf = getEnvConfig('serviceAccount')
  ```

**Not In Global**
Usage of config variables should not within the global functions scope. This is because deploying becomes broken on all environments that donâ€™t have it setup (i.e trying to deploy to your local when have not setup reside libraries).

  ```js
  // DO NOT DO THIS
  const serviceAccountConf = functions.config().serviceAccount

  // DO THIS INSTEAD
  function doSomething() {
    const serviceAccountConf = getEnvConfig('serviceAccount')
    // logic that uses serviceAccountConf
  }
  ```

**NOTE** Variables do not need to contain the word "config"

## Cloud Storage Interaction
Get the bucket from the admin instance which is already initialized:

  ```js
  import * as admin from 'firebase-admin'

  const bucket = admin.storage().bucket()
  bucket.file()
  ```

Can also be used for other buckets:

```js
import * as admin from 'firebase-admin'

const otherBucket = admin.storage().bucket('other-bucket')
otherBucket.file()
```

## Async Logic

* Use `async` functions so that `await` can be used
* Use `to` from `utils/async` to prevent nested try/catches
* Break each stage up so that top level function reads clearly

```js
import { to } from 'utils/async';

// Write error to response object
const [writeErr] = await to(
  admin.database().ref('responses/asdf').set({
    processed: true,
    error: errMsg,
    processing: false,
  })
);

// Handle errors writing error response to RTDB
if (writeErr) {
  console.error(
    `Error writing error response to RTDB: ${writeErr.message || ''}`,
    writeErr
  );
  throw writeErr;
}
```
